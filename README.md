1)I retrieved data on GitHub users in Mumbai with over 50 followers using the GitHub API, gathering details on follower counts, repository languages, licenses, and account creation dates. I calculated results programmatically in Python on Google Colab, verifying accuracy with CSV-based analysis.

2)The most surprising finding was that developers with high followers and leader strength often had shorter bios; a low correlation between bio length and followers indicated that bio details had minimal impact on follower count.

3)To increase followers, developers should focus on quality repository content, especially in popular languages like Python or JavaScript, as higher stars and follower counts correlate more strongly with repository popularity than bio details; notably, correlation between followers and public repositories was strong, with higher repository counts linked to more followers.
