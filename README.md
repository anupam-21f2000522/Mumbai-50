1)I have used the GitHub API to retrieve data on users located in Mumbai with over 50 followers, gathering detailed user and repository information including follower counts, repository languages, licenses, and account creation dates.
Have calculated the results programatically using python in google colab and the also matched the result using the analysis of the csv created.

2)The most surprising insight is that the majority of developers with high followers and leader strength metrics often had shorter bios, contrary to the expectation that detailed bios attract more followers.
I have found that the correlation between bio length and followers was low (r ≈ 0.1), indicating minimal impact of bio detail on follower count.

To increase followers, developers should prioritize quality content in repositories—especially popular languages like Python or JavaScript—as our analysis shows higher stars and follower counts correlate with repository popularity, not necessarily bio length or personal details.
Correlation between followers and public repositories was strong (r ≈ 0.7), showing that developers with more repositories tended to have higher follower counts.
